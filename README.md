#Proposal
This project aims to collect informations about top movies. There are multiple movie web sites(like imdb,sinemalar etc.) and this project is about to combine informations from multiple web sites about the same movie. Like one movie in imdb could get lower point from users but the same movie could get higher points from other web sites, in this project points will be united with the movie genres.After that popularity of movies will be shown with graphical box plots. 

Python and beutifulsoap will be used for fetching informations from web sites.
